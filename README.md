## The ANAIS Experiment

ANAIS (Annual modulation with NaI Scintillators) is a dark matter direct detection experiment located at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC), in Spain, operated by a team of researchers of the CAPA at the University of Zaragoza. ANAIS' goal is to confirm or refute in a model independent way the DAMA/LIBRA experiment positive result: an annual modulation in the low-energy detection rate having all the features expected for the signal induced by weakly interacting dark matter particles (WIMPs) in a standard galactic halo.
